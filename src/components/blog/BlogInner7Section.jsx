                When an application undergoes a crash it behaves differently and
                malfunctions, so let's discuss such misbehaving features when an
                app crash:

                App discontinuation: Whenever an app closes or terminates
                suddenly, it indicates that the app is not responding and has
                been stopped. This behavior shows an app crash.

                    A stack trace or error log takes place right after the
                    crash, which records the exact point in the code where the
                    crash occurred. This feature is really important for
                    developers to detect app crashes and be able to resolve the
                    cause.
                  </span>

                  </span>
                  <span>
                    Sometimes the app does not fully close but freezes at a
                    particular point or becomes unresponsive, which is also
                    considered as an app crash.

                  <span>
                    Abrupt closure of an application can often lead to loss of
                    previous data and the app restarts from the initial phase.
                    This loss of data and progress also indicates that the app
                    was malfunctioning and crashed.

                For Android, there are crash reporting tools like Firebase
                Crashlytics, Sentry, etc which can be used by developers to
                capture crash reports. By those reports, you can detect the
                crash along with device information, stack traces, and
                information about the conditions at which the crash occurred. It
                makes it easier for the developers to detect and diagnose the
                issue.

                Application not responding error (ANR) is another sign of an app
