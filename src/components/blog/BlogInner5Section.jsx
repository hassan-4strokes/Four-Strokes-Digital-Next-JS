                For instance, Apple turned its commission structure around to
                favor App Store subscription developers, starting from and after
                a user has subscribed for over one year. Apple charges a 30%
                commission for app purchases and subscriptions. After one year
                of continuous subscription by a user, the commission takes the
                15% form, so the developer can retain a higher fraction of every
                subscription fee. In this manner, it will nudge developers
                towards doing whatever it takes to develop solid value retention
                that will keep subscribers for much longer.

                When creating subscriptions, a good place to start is by

                    Suitable for apps that have them provide only one core

                    access with just one tier subscription.

                    Most of the apps utilized by the media, productivity, and
                    education apps offer varying levels of subscription-basic,
                    premium, and even VIP tiers, letting the users determine

                Most companies specializing in iOS development indicate that one
                should have a multi-tiered pricing method to cater to many
                customers. According to Sensor Tower, the average conversion
                rate of applications with flexible pricing is 25% more than
                those with fixed pricing. It also makes sense to do a free trial
                to encourage new users to use the app's value before paying.

                commission from 30% to 15% when the user subscribes for over a
                year. This makes for a strong foundation to base retention while
                building a product that becomes essential to the users.

                1. Data-Driven Retention Strategies Use data analysis tools in
                App Store Connect and third-party analytics to identify churn
                signals, such as reduced usage before renewal periods. Armed
                with this knowledge, you can attempt to re-engage these users

                2. Test Subscription Features and Pricing through A/B Testing
                Test different pricing, content access, and offers to new and
                existing users. An example would be "win back" discount offers
                to recently canceled subscribers. Another testing option would
                be the provision of free trials with different durations to
                determine the optimal period that can allow its users to
                increase their chances for conversion and retention.

                subscription-based successful applications offer features
                derived from communities like forums, leaderboards, or shared
                content spaces, driving subscribers to engage with one another.
                This kind of belonging and investment in the app yields a better
