Its popularity stems from its hot reload feature, customizable widgets, and ability to deliver native-like performance."},{heading:"What is MAUI, and how does it compare to Flutter?",text:"MAUI, or .NET Multi-platform App UI, is a Microsoft framework for building cross-platform apps. Unlike Flutter, which uses Dart, MAUI integrates with the .NET ecosystem and uses XAML for UI design."},{heading:"How does Flutter differ from MAUI in performance?",text:"Flutter relies on the Skia rendering engine to achieve consistent performance across platforms, while MAUI utilizes native APIs for direct hardware access, offering smoother performance on supported platforms."},{heading:"What are the pros and cons of Flutter vs. MAUI?",text:"Flutter excels in rapid development, rich widgets, and community support but needs NET ecosystem integration. MAUI is ideal for .NET developers and enterprise apps but has a smaller community and learning curve."},{heading:"Which framework is more cost-effective for app development?",text:"Due to its vast library of pre-built widgets and tools, Flutter is often more cost-effective for startups and smaller projects. MAUI might be more cost-effective for enterprises already using .NET technologies."}],x=[{heading:"What is Xamarin, and how does it compare to Flutter?",text:"Xamarin is a Microsoft-owned framework for creating native-like apps using C#.
